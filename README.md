# River crossing puzzle in TLA+

## Problem

A farmer is on one shore of a river and has with him a fox, a chicken, and a
sack of grain. He has a boat that fits one object besides himself. In the
presence of the farmer nothing gets eaten, but if left without the farmer, the
fox will eat the chicken, and the chicken will eat the grain. How can the farmer
get all three possessions across the river safely?
